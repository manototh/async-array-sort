# Sort the elements of an array asynchronously with JavaScript

This is an exercise to solve the classic problem of sorting the elements of an array. The added twist is that this solution uses asynchronous functions to sort the array from both directions simultaneously. One thread sorts elements from the lowest value up, and another thread sorts the elements from the highest value down.

## Creating and sorting an array

To create and sort an array, follow these steps:

1. Create a copy of the file `source/main.js`, and open it with your text editor.
2. At the bottom of the file, delete the example.
3. Call the `generateAndSortArray` function, specifying the number of elements in the generated array as its parameter.

As a result, you have created and sorted an array.
